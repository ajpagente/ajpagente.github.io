![6.5-inch screenshot](/assets/images/iPhone-6.5-inch-screenshot-reqt.PNG) 

To publish an iOS app that supports iPhone, a 6.5 inch screenshot is mandatory. 
The App Store Connect screenshot specifications includes the following devices under 6.5 inch device size. 
* iPhone 11 Pro Max
* iPhone 11
* iPhone XS Max
* iPhone XR

You can capture screenshots with the iOS simulator and initially I used **iPhone XR**. However the screenshots were rejected by App Store Connect since the size captured is  828x1792 pixels (portrait).
To capture a screenshot size of 1242x2688 pixels (portrait) use **iPhone XS Max** simulator.

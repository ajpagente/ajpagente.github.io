# Me
Hola! I'm **AJ**, welcome to my blog! 

There are many reasons why I blog...
- **To give back**: I benefit from other people's blogs and open-source projects, I hope you can benefit from mine as well
- **To understand**: Dr. Richard Feynman uses a learning technique which essentially boils down to - if you can explain a subject in the simplest way, you have understood it.
- **To remember**: There's just so many things to learn and experience and there is no way one can remember all of it. Hence I write it down so when the day comes that I need it, I have a place to refer to.  
- **To improve**: Getting feedback is the best way to get better. I value collaboration and constructive feedback so let me know what can I improve.
